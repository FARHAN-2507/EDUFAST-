                    <p>It Contains all about HTML,CSS and Javascript. <br>
                        HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the
                        meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to
                        describe a web page's appearance/presentation ( CSS) or functionality/behavior ( JavaScript ).
                        "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another

                    <h3>Python</h3>
                    <p>Python is a computer programming language often used to build websites and software, automate
                        tasks, and conduct data analysis. Python is a general-purpose language, meaning it can be used
                        to create a variety of different programs and isnâ€™t specialized for any specific problems. This
                        versatility, along with its beginner-friendliness, has made it one of the most-used programming
                        languages today.</p>
